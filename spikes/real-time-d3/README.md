# Real-Time D3 Spike

In order to get the desired result for test reporting we need the following:

1) Get data into a json format
2) Update json file in realtime with websockets
3) and in this spike, learn how to get d3 to work with real time data, presumably answering questions such as
    * can I really just update a json file? 

This spike is based on this medium post
