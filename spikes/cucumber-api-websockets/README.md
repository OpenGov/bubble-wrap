# To Run
To run websockets, run this command:

`websocketd --port=9001 --staticdir=. ./subscriber.sh`

# Notes

Cucumber sends a checkbox which does not parse out right in the example. Don't let it bother you.


## TODO 

* parse out essential details of cucumber features including

* scenario title
* directories
* test result
